**PROJECT DESCRIPTION**

The aim of this project is to implement a full-fledged processor based on the DLX architecture. The project covers the steps of digital design, simulation and synthesis stages.
The project is part of Microelectronic Systems course, held by Professor Mariagrazia Graziano in the first year of Embedded Systems Master Degree at Politecnico di Torino.

**REPOSITORY STRUCTURE**

The vhd folder contains all vhd files used in simulation, plus some scripts that allow to set up simulation parameters.
There are two TLEs available, one used in simulation (a-DLX.vhd) and one used for synthesis (a-DLX-FS.vhd).

The compiler folder contains some scripts that allow to compile asm files written in DLX assembly language.
In the example folder there are some assembly programs, used to test and validate the DLX.

See the included report for any further information.
